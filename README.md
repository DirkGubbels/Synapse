# Synapse
This repo contains various utility files for use with Azure Synapse Analytics

### ImportSynapseSupportFiles
This PowerShell script imports the files that are generated by running the 'export support files' on a pipeline in Synapse.
It will import the pipelines and all referenced linked services, datasets, dataflows, pipelines and integration runtimes

This makes migrating pipelines to other environments much easier
