# Synapse
This repo contains various utility files for use with Azure Synapse Analytics

### ImportSynapseSupportFiles
This PowerShell script imports the files that are generated by running the 'export support files' on a pipeline in Synapse.
It will import the pipelines and all referenced linked services, datasets, dataflows, pipelines and integration runtimes

This makes migrating pipelines to other environments much easier

### Export Synapse Notebooks to folder structure.ps1
This powerShell script exports all notebooks and SQL files from Synapse studio, preserving the folder structure. 
The standard export will not recreate the folder structure. This script fills that gap
